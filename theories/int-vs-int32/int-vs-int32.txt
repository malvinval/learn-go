int:
The size of the int data type in Go depends on the architecture of the machine on which the program is run.
On a 32-bit architecture, int has a size of 32 bits (4 bytes).
On a 64-bit architecture, int has a size of 64 bits (8 bytes).
Therefore, the size of the int data type varies.

int32:
The int32 data type always has a size of 32 bits (4 bytes), no matter where the program is run.
Therefore, int32 always has a consistent size.
